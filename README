This is an attempt to implement a BigInt class for Rakudo, to tide us over
until Rakudo's Int class can handle arbitrary precision internally.

Installing:
Math::BigInt is set up as a normal Perl 6 module.  However, it has rather more
prerequisites than normal:

1) You must have Zavolaj installed and working.  

2) You must have the BigDigits routines installed as a dynamic libbd library
on your system. The BigDigits source is available from
http://www.di-mgt.com.au/bigdigits.html .  However, it doesn't have any provision
for making and installing the needed library.  Right now you need to do this by
hand.  I hope to provide platform independent makefiles for this at some point.

3) Right now it calls malloc, free, and strcat from libSystem. If you're on a
platform other than OS X, you'll have to change this to the appropriate place
to find those calls. (This is lines 15-17 in lib/Math/BigInt.pm.) Again, I
hope to have a better workaround for this someday.

Once all that is in place, this is easily built using the standard ufo tool:

ufo
make
make test
make install

As of this writing, neither BigDigits nor Math::BigInts properly handles
negative numbers. Hopefully this is a temporary limitation.

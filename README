This is an attempt to implement a BigInt class for Rakudo, to tide us over
until Rakudo's Int class can handle arbitrary precision internally.

Installing:
Math::BigInt is set up as a normal Perl 6 module.  However, it has rather more
prerequisites than normal:

1) You must have Zavolaj installed and working.  

2) You must have the BigDigits routines installed as a dynamic libbd library
on your system. The BigDigits source is available from
http://www.di-mgt.com.au/bigdigits.html and build tools to make it libbd are 
included in this library's build-BigDigit directory.  Try:

    cd build-BigDigit
    curl -O http://www.di-mgt.com.au/src/BigDigits.2.2.0.zip
    unzip BigDigits.2.2.0.zip
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    cd ..

Once all that is in place, this is easily built using the standard ufo tool:

ufo
make
make test
make install

As of this writing, neither BigDigits nor Math::BigInts properly handles
negative numbers. Hopefully this is a temporary limitation.
